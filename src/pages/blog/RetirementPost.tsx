    <h2>Why Retirement Planning Matters in Nigeria</h2>
    <p>
      With Nigeria’s life expectancy rising to around 55 years (WHO, 2023), planning for retirement is more critical than ever. Whether you’re a young professional in Lagos or nearing retirement in Abuja, securing your financial future ensures peace of mind. At Nivalus Bank, we’re here to guide you with practical strategies tailored to the Nigerian economy.
    </p>
    <h2>Top Tips to Save for Retirement</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Contribute to the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS):</strong> Enroll with a Pension Fund Administrator (PFA) under Nigeria’s CPS, mandated by the Pension Reform Act. Employees contribute 8% of their salary, matched by employers at 10%, building a robust retirement fund.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open a High-Yield Savings Account:</strong> Nivalus offers savings accounts with competitive interest rates (e.g., up to 5% APY). Regular deposits, even ₦5,000 monthly, can grow significantly over time due to compound interest.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Invest in Low-Risk Options:</strong> Explore CBN-regulated treasury bills (yielding ~15% in 2025) or mutual funds through Nivalus’s investment services. These provide steady returns with minimal risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Budget for Retirement:</strong> Use Nivalus’s free Budget Planner tool to allocate funds for retirement. Cutting unnecessary expenses, like frequent dining out, can free up more savings.
